                    <li><strong>Extended: </strong>Similar to that of Standard, but once a player lose 3 dummies on any side. The game is not over. Instead destroy everything on that lawn, and nothing can be played there from now on. Then, the losing players gets 2 extra resources and draws 1 extra card of the side that did not lose. Both player no longer draw cards from the deck of the side thats no longer played. The losing players have 3 turns to beat the winning players on the last lawn to win, otherwise they lose. </li>
                    <li><strong>Classic Vs: </strong>Instead of using a deck, each player picks sides and chooses 1 card of their side back and forth until both players have chosen 6 cards. During the Start Phase, the turn player adds cards from outside the game so that they have one of each card chosen at the start of the game. A player can only pick 1 Legendary card.</li>
